# .dotfiles

Your `dotfiles` are how you personalize your system. These are the base dotfiles that I start with when I set up a new environment (for more specific local needs I use the `*.local` files).

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!
